_The Twelve Days of Christmas_.

### Test Suite

A failing test suite is provided in `./test/twelve_days_test.rb`.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to make the tests pass.

The test suite can be run with any of the following commands:

```plain
$ ruby test/twelve_days_test.rb
$ rake test
$ rake
```

All but the first test have been marked pending using the `skip` method.
This means that they will not spew error messages at you, even if they're
not passing. To get a test to run and show you the error message, delete
the `skip`.

To run a single test, use the name of the test:

```plain
$ ruby test/twelve_days_test.rb --name test_verse_1
```

### Optional: Acceptance Test

Another failing test is provided in `./features/twelve-days.feature`.
It can be run with any of the following commands:

```plain
$ cucumber
$ cucumber features
$ rake cucumber
```
