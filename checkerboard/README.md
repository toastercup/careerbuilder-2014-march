# Checkerboard

**WARNING: _This is not TDD_**

## Running the Tests

An exercise in refactoring under green.

Run the test suite with the following command:

```ruby
$ ruby test/checkerboard_test.rb
```

All but the first test are marked as pending using the `skip` method.

Make the first test pass with the simplest code possible.
Once that test is passing, refactor in tiny steps.

The test should not ever fail. Refactor until you can unskip
the second test and have it be passing already.
